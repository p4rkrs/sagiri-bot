**Sagiri** is a modular bot, personalizable, with a lot of interaction. We want to continue in this way, and do our best for improve that.

# Getting Started
## Requirements
* **Node.js 6+**

A firm grasp of **ES6 + async/await** syntax is optional but recommended.

As the bot framework extends the [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/Eris) client, please refer to the docs [here](https://abal.moe/Eris/docs).
